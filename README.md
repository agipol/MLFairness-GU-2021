# When is AI biased? Measuring fairness in machine learning models

Even if you have limited knowledge about machine learning and how it works, it is impacting many aspects of your life. Nowadays, more and more decisions are being made using algorithms and predictive models. Unfortunately, some of these models discriminate against certain subpopulations. This workshop will begin by explaining how a machine learning model works. We will then examine how a model might be biased and how different types of bias can infiltrate learning algorithms. We then consider different approaches for measuring unfairness and present different methods for reducing unfairness.

A two-day workshop with the Massive Data Institute, Georgetown University.

## Goals
In this workshop, you will:
- learn how machine learning models can influence our everyday lives and understand some important characteristics they must exhibit,
- learn about the basic phases of a prediction problem,
- understand the most important types of biases that may be present,
- view examples of biased models in different domains,
- explore how we can quantify fairness for a binary classification task, and a recommendation task,
- gain insights about how we can build fair models.
